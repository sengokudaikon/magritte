# Contributing to Magritte

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Magritte is currently a one-man experiment. If you are interested in helping out and making Magritte a better ORM, you're welcome to follow the rules.

## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I have a question

If you have a question to ask, please do not open an issue for it. It's quicker to open a [GitHub Discussion](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart#creating-a-new-discussion) on the corresponding repository or ask in Discord (link here)

## I need a feature

Feature requests from anyone are welcome! I will implement feature proposals if 1) I have the time for it 2) it benefits everyone, but of course, code contributions will more likely be accepted.

## I want to support

The best way to support the project is to contribute, recommend it to your classmates/colleagues/friends, write blog posts and tutorials on SurrealDB, share the projects and help out other users in the community. Promoting the library in official SurrealDB communities would also be a major boon.

## I want to join

I mean, if you want to work on the project, you're welcome just 'cause.

## I want to sponsor

If you don't have time to contribute but would like to support the organization, a financial contribution via [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/sengokudaikon) is a great way to support us.
